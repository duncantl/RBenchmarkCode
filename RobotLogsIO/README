This example comes from Sam Buttrey and colleagues at the Naval Postgraduate School in Monterey, CA.

This example illustrates reading data from  log files from robots moving around
a course looking for a circular target.
It has some characteristics in common with the WirelessDataIO example,
i.e. ragged data and having to copy values from one vector to a different form.

Here we read an entire log file and create a matrix of
observations. Each observation has a time, location (x, y), and a
"range" for each of 361 angles. The ranges tell us how far the robot
can see in a circle around where it is located, up to 2 meters.  If a
range is less than 2, this means there is something closer to the
robot in that direction, i.e. an obstacle or the target.

This application can be readily cast as an online algorithm where we read new data
and then determine if we have located the target.

The readAll*.R files provide 3 refinments of reading the data.

simpleRead.R reads the data line by line but keeps the payloads for
the different types of lines as strings which need to be
post-processed later.


We have 100 log files. I have included only one here - Example.log.



We can go further than just IO here.  The idea is, for each location
the robot visits, to determine if it sees the target. To do this, it
determines the contiguous segments in the circle where it "sees"
something.  For each of these, it uses non-linear least squares to
determine of the "boundary" it sees is consistent with a circle of
radius approximately .5 meters.
