This is a repository of code that might be of interest to people working on making R faster. These are, as usual, specific applications rather than universally applicable R idioms. However, many of them are "real world"y and focus on how we do things in R.

See index.html for a list of the applications.

The hope is that people will contribute or allow us to link to other examples.
