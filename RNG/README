This collection of run* scripts illustrate different approaches to
sampling from distributions.  One uses the inverse Cumulative
Distribution Function (CDF) approach. Another uses
acceptance-rejection sampling for a two dimensionsal density. Finally,
there are some simple Markov Chain Monte Carlo examples with a
reasonably general MCMC function to which the caller provides the 
stationary density function, the proposal function
