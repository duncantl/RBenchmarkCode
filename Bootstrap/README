This is a very simple application of the statistical bootstrap technique.

One of the goals of this example is to identify that we can reuse the same
memory for each of the bootstrap  iterations.
We can also parallelize the bootstrap since the order in which the replications
are performed is not important. So we can use a pool of threads to evaluate
the replications.  We can reuse memory within each thread across iteration.

We might also try to map the code to a GPU.

There are also interesting things one can do with the bootstrap as 
many observations will be repeated in a non-parametric bootstrap (37% 
of the original observations won't be in each bootstrap sample). Hence
we can take advantage of this replication to compute the statistic of interest.
