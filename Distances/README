Distances play an important role in many statistical methods,
e.g. clustering, k-nearest neighbors, support vector machines, and
generally kernel methods.

We would like to be able to compute distances with R code rather than
relying on C code.  Furthermore, the R dist() function requires a
single matrix or data frame and then computes pairwise-distances for
all pairs of rows in the data. Often we have a single observation or a
test data set and a training set and we want the distances between
each observation in our test data and each observation in the traing
data. We have to i) stack the training and test data into a single
matrix/data frame and ii) compute a lot of distances that we then
discard (i.e. within test and within training distances).

We want to avoid the memory issues, i.e. stacking and converting a data frame to a matrix.

Furthermore, we would like to be able to parallelize the code, perhaps
even implementing it on GPUs.

We would also like to be able to add new distance metrics.


The Dist() function in Dist.R is very simple and the obvious way to write the general
distance computation for two data sets.  
Compilation should try to avoid creating the intermediate row vectors.
