This implements a reinforced random walk. This is similar to the 2D
random walk, but the probabilities of the 4 directions we might choose
depend on whether we have visited the current point before. In other
words, when we end up back at a point we previously visited, the
probabilities for the next step change.

Unlike a simple 2D random walk, we have to record where we have visited and be able
to look this up for a position.

This example is taken from Mark Holmes in Auckland, New Zealand.

I also have versions in Lisp and R that calls C code.
