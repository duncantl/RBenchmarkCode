This code simulates the Biham Midleton Levine "car" model.
This is interesting because it is a very simple model that
exhibits a phase transition.

We randomly locate rho cars on a grid. A car is either red or blue.
Red cars move horizontally to the right; blue cars move vertically upward.
When a car reaches the edge of the grid, it wraps around to the other edge
(in the same row or column). In other words, the grid acts as a torus.


We implement the simulation using a matrix to represent the state of the grid.
We can chose and explore different data structures, but this is adequate
and reasonably simple and efficient.
