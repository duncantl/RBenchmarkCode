This is an example of how we would change how we program something if looping in R were faster.

The idea here is to take a random sample of lines from a file.
We can do this in one of 3 ways
 1. read all the lines and then subset the elements in the sample
 2. read each line one at a time and keep the ones we want
 3. read a block of line up to the next line in our sample and keep that last line in each block.

The first approach uses a lot of memory, storing all N lines.
The second approach involves a loop over O(N) lines.
The third approach involves a loop with as many iterations as the sample size. It does
use more memory than 2. as we have to store an entire block.

When loops are compiled and fast, 2. is the best approach.
However, in regular (GNU) R, this is extremely expensive.


A C implement of 2 is available in the R package at
