This illustrates processing data that come in ragged form, i.e.  with
a different number of values on each line.  The context is wireless
signals in a building recorded by a research moving through the
building with a hand-held device that records the strength of the
wireless signals it detects.

The data are from CRAWDAD.

Lines of interest in the file are of the form:

t=1139643118358;id=00:02:2D:21:0F:33;pos=0.0,0.0,0.0;degree=0.0;00:14:bf:b1:97:8a=-38,2437000000,3;00:14:bf:b1:97:90=-56,2427000000,3;00:0f:a3:39:e1:c0=-53,2462000000,3;00:14:bf:b1:97:8d=-65,2442000000,3;00:14:bf:b1:97:81=-65,2422000000,3;00:14:bf:3b:c7:c6=-66,2432000000,3;00:0f:a3:39:dd:cd=-75,2412000000,3;00:0f:a3:39:e0:4b=-78,2462000000,3;00:0f:a3:39:e2:10=-87,2437000000,3;02:64:fb:68:52:e6=-88,2447000000,1;02:00:42:55:31:00=-84,2457000000,1

Elements are separated by ;. The first 4 elements are time, hand-held device identifier, location in the building and the orientation/degree indicating the direction the researcher is facing.

After these, there is an element for each device that was detected at this point in time.
Each element is of the form
   02:00:42:55:31:00=-84,2457000000,1
i.e. the MAC of the device detected followed by = then the signal strength, the channel and an indicator (1 or 3) that identifies if the device was a fixed base station or a mobile device.
